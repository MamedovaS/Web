                <p className="text--info"> Zoos, as institutions, are places where people can connect with a diverse range of animal species from all corners of the globe. While they offer the unique opportunity to witness wildlife up close and personal, they are often at the center of a longstanding ethical debate. On one hand, zoos play a crucial role in conservation efforts, contributing to the preservation of endangered species and supporting vital research. They also educate the public about the importance of wildlife and the challenges they face. However, on the other hand, concerns about animal welfare and captivity conditions persist. Striking a balance between these dual roles—conservation and ethics—is an ongoing challenge for zoos, as they navigate the responsibility to both protect wildlife and ensure the well-being of the animals under their care.</p>
